I have a passion for problem-solving and am able to come up with multiple possible solutions to problems allowing me to quickly arrive at a working solution. I grew up playing video games and became a huge fan of puzzle games such as Portal, Q.U.B.E, and many more. It was because of games like these that I was able to use my brain to think in creative ways and develop the problem-solving mindset I have today.
As a full-stack software developer. I have enjoyed using Javascript, Python, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, CSS, HTML, and Flask. I'm always searching for new opportunities to refine my skills and eagerly ready for the next project that awaits me.
